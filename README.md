## Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Energy Exploration

This is an ongoing project to centralize, standardize, and explore publicly available data about nuclear weapons testing and nuclear power reactors. Much of the existing data is distributed broadly among a number of sources, and some of it (especially where nuclear testing is concerned, and even moreso for thermonuclear testing) is fragmented or incomplete. If this is a subject that interests you, feel free to use and explore the datasets in this repository. If you notice something incorrect or missing, feel free to contact me or submit an issue and I'll try to resolve it as soon as I can.

If you just want to see the maps and summaries, you can head to the repo <a href = "d-bowen.github.io"> website,</a> which will expand to include a more narrative presentation of the data.
